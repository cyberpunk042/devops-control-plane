  Python is a versatile, high-level programming language used for web
  development, data science, automation, and systems scripting. Its large
  ecosystem of packages makes it one of the most popular choices for backend
  services and tooling.
  
  Technical: Generic Python stack detected via pyproject.toml, setup.py, or
  requirements.txt. Provides install, lint (ruff), format, test (pytest), and
  type-check (mypy) capabilities. Flavored stacks like python-flask or
  python-fastapi extend this with framework-specific commands.
