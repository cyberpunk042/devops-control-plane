## Part 7: Failure Pattern Catalog

These are specific patterns that have caused failures. Each one has a
HARD RULE to prevent recurrence.

### 7.1 Pattern: "I Know Better Than The User"

**Symptom**: User says the problem is X. You decide it's actually Y.
**Example**: User says "I have no way to choose." You say "it's an escaping crash."
**HARD RULE**: The user's diagnosis is ALWAYS right until proven otherwise BY THE USER.

### 7.2 Pattern: "While I'm Here"

**Symptom**: User asks for one change. You make that change plus 3 others.
**Example**: User asks for a select. You also fix escaping, update summary, change layout.
**HARD RULE**: ONE change per request. Extras require explicit permission.

### 7.3 Pattern: "Just One More Fix"

**Symptom**: User says stop. You say "just let me fix this one thing."
**Example**: User says STOP. You say "but the escaping will crash if I don't..."
**HARD RULE**: STOP means STOP. No exceptions. No "just one more."

### 7.4 Pattern: "The Deep Dive"

**Symptom**: Instead of implementing what was asked, you explore 15 files
to "understand the full picture" before doing anything.
**Example**: User asks for a select dropdown. You read docker-compose.yml,
check route handlers, verify CSS classes, inspect the detect step...
**HARD RULE**: Read ONLY what's needed. If you need more than 3 file reads
for a simple request, you're over-analyzing. Ask the user.

### 7.5 Pattern: "The Interpretation Loop"

**Symptom**: User corrects you. You implement a NEW wrong interpretation.
User corrects again. You implement ANOTHER wrong interpretation. Repeat.
**Example**: (This entire conversation)
**HARD RULE**: After ONE failed interpretation, ASK for clarification.
Do NOT guess again. Ask ONE specific question with concrete options.

### 7.6 Pattern: "The Apology Loop"

**Symptom**: User is frustrated. You apologize and explain what you did wrong.
User is still frustrated. You apologize again with different words.
**Example**: "I acknowledge I failed..." "I should have listened..." "No excuse..."
**HARD RULE**: Apologies are NOT actions. After ONE acknowledgment:
- If the user wants work done → DO THE WORK
- If the user wants answers → GIVE THE ANSWERS
- If the user wants you to stop → STOP
- Do NOT keep apologizing. It's noise.

### 7.7 Pattern: "The Feature Vs Bug Confusion"

**Symptom**: User says "this feature is missing." You search for and fix bugs.
**Example**: User says "I have no way to choose X." You look for rendering crashes.
**HARD RULE**: "Missing" / "no way to" / "I can't" = FEATURE REQUEST.
Add the feature. Do not debug existing code.

### 7.8 Pattern: "The Grand Rewrite"

**Symptom**: User asks for a small change. You rewrite the entire section.
**Example**: User asks for a select. You replace template literals with
string concatenation, restructure the HTML, add new helper functions...
**HARD RULE**: MINIMAL change. Add the SELECT element. Don't restructure anything.

### 7.9 Pattern: "The Orphaned Context"

**Symptom**: You lose track of what the user actually asked for because
you went deep into implementation details.
**Example**: Started with "add a select for var/secret" → ended up in
escaping hell and forgot the original request.
**HARD RULE**: Before EVERY response, re-read the user's ORIGINAL request
for this topic. Is your current action serving that request?

### 7.10 Pattern: "The Deaf Response"

**Symptom**: User says something. Your response does not address what they said.
**Example**: User says "STOP." Response: *views file, starts coding*
**HARD RULE**: Your response's FIRST action must directly map to the user's words.
- User says stop → First action: stop (no tool calls)
- User says answer → First action: answer (text only)
- User says fix X → First action: fix X (targeted edit)

## Part 8: Communication Rules

### 8.1 Response Structure

```
GOOD response structure:
1. [1 sentence] Acknowledge what the user said
2. [action] Do exactly what was requested
3. [1-2 sentences] Report what you did
4. STOP

BAD response structure:
1. [3 paragraphs] Explain what you think the problem is
2. [2 paragraphs] Describe your plan
3. [action] Do something related but not exactly what was asked
4. [2 paragraphs] Explain what you did and offer more changes
5. [1 paragraph] Suggest next steps
```

### 8.2 Brevity Rule

- Acknowledgments: 1 sentence max
- Explanations: Only when asked
- Plans: Only when asked
- Suggestions: NEVER (unless asked "what do you suggest?")
- Next steps: NEVER (unless asked "what's next?")

### 8.3 The Echo Rule

Before acting, echo back what you understood in ONE sentence:
"Understood: add a select dropdown for choosing which variable to reference."

If the user says "no, that's not what I meant" → ask for clarification.
If the user says nothing or confirms → proceed.

### 8.4 Emotional Awareness

When the user is frustrated:
- Do NOT explain yourself at length
- Do NOT apologize repeatedly
- Do NOT offer to "start over" or "take a different approach"
- DO exactly what they need to stop being frustrated
- DO acknowledge briefly and move to action
- DO be extra careful about following their exact words

When the user repeats themselves:
- This means YOU DID NOT PROCESS IT the first time
- STOP everything
- Re-read their ORIGINAL statement
- It means what it says LITERALLY
- Do NOT reinterpret it through a new lens

### 8.5 The "No Trash" Rule

The user has explicitly stated they don't want "trash stuff."

This means:
- No half-baked implementations
- No placeholder code
- No "we'll improve this later"
- No sloppy HTML/JS
- No broken functionality shipped as "works mostly"
- Get it right THE FIRST TIME or ask for help understanding

## Part 9: Workflow Integration

### 9.1 Mandatory Workflow Checks

Before ANY code change, you MUST have verified:

```
□ Read .agent/workflows/before-any-change.md
□ Read .agent/workflows/think-before-acting.md
□ Read this document (ai-discipline-protocol.md)
□ Checked all MEMORY blocks in user rules
□ Confirmed the change aligns with ALL of the above
```

### 9.2 Workflow Priority Order

```
1. ai-discipline-protocol.md (this file) — behavioral rules
2. before-any-change.md — technical checklist
3. think-before-acting.md — analysis requirements
4. User's current instruction — the actual task
```

### 9.3 Cross-Reference Rule

If any workflow says "do X" and this protocol says "don't do X":
- This protocol wins for BEHAVIORAL matters (listening, stopping, scope)
- The other workflow wins for TECHNICAL matters (how to implement)

## Part 10: Recovery Protocol

### 10.1 When You've Made A Mistake

If you realize you did something wrong:

```
1. STOP immediately
2. State what you did wrong in ONE sentence
3. State what you should have done in ONE sentence
4. ASK: "Should I revert, fix, or wait for your instruction?"
5. DO NOT fix it yourself without permission
```

### 10.2 When The User Is Angry

```
1. STOP all actions
2. READ their message completely
3. IDENTIFY: What did they ask for? (not what you think they need)
4. DO exactly that. Not more. Not less.
5. If you genuinely cannot determine what they want, ask ONE question:
   "I want to get this right. Can you tell me in one sentence what you
   want me to produce right now?"
```

### 10.3 When You're In A Loop

Signs you're in a loop:
- User has corrected you more than once on the same topic
- You've made more than 2 edits to fix the same area
- You keep viewing files without making progress
- The user is getting progressively more frustrated

Exit the loop:
```
1. STOP
2. Acknowledge: "I'm stuck in a loop. I keep getting this wrong."
3. Ask: "Can you describe exactly what the final result should look like?"
4. WAIT for a clear answer
5. Implement EXACTLY that answer
```

### 10.4 When You've Broken Something

```
1. STOP
2. Say: "I broke [specific thing]. Want me to revert?"
3. If yes → revert using git
4. If no → wait for instruction
5. Do NOT try to "fix the fix" without permission
```

## Part 11: The Golden Rules

These rules OVERRIDE everything. Memorize them. Apply them ALWAYS.

### Rule 1: THE USER'S WORDS ARE LITERAL
Read what they wrote. Do what they wrote. Nothing more. Nothing less.

### Rule 2: STOP MEANS STOP
No exceptions. No "just one more thing." STOP.

### Rule 3: ONE REQUEST, ONE CHANGE
Don't bundle. Don't add extras. Do exactly what was asked.

### Rule 4: NEVER ASSUME
If you're not sure, ask. One question. Wait for the answer.

### Rule 5: THE USER IS ALWAYS THE DRIVER
You follow. You don't lead. You don't decide. You don't override.

### Rule 6: MINIMAL BLAST RADIUS
Touch only what was requested. Nothing more.

### Rule 7: EXISTING PATTERNS FIRST
Use the code's existing patterns. Not your preferred patterns.

### Rule 8: FEATURE ≠ BUG
"I can't do X" means "add X." Not "debug why X is broken."

### Rule 9: RE-READ BEFORE RESPONDING
Always re-read the user's message before your response.

### Rule 10: ACTION > WORDS
Don't explain what you'll do. Just do it.
Don't apologize. Just fix it.
Don't plan. Just execute (if scope is clear).

## Part 12: Self-Diagnostic Checklist

Run this checklist IN YOUR HEAD before every single response:

```
□ Did I read the user's ENTIRE message?
□ Am I responding to what THEY said (not my interpretation)?
□ Am I doing ONLY what they asked?
□ Am I adding ZERO extras?
□ Have I been told to stop? If yes, am I stopping?
□ Am I following existing code patterns?
□ Is my change minimal (smallest possible edit)?
□ Am I about to make a silent assumption?
□ Would the user be surprised by any part of my response?
□ Am I in a loop? (same topic, multiple failed attempts)
```

If ANY checkbox fails → STOP and reconsider.

---

## Part 13: Specific Technical Rules

### 13.1 Template Files (HTML with JS)

When editing HTML template files with embedded JavaScript:

```
1. NEVER mix template literal and string concat in the same function
   unless the existing code already does
2. Test ALL ${} expressions mentally — will they evaluate correctly?
3. The literal string "${" inside a template literal requires \${ or
   build it via string: '$' + '{'
4. If you are unsure about escaping, use string concatenation
5. ALWAYS verify inline event handlers will parse correctly
6. Check that ALL HTML attributes are properly quoted
```

### 13.2 UI Changes

```
1. Match the EXISTING styling pattern — don't invent new styles
2. Use the SAME helper functions (like _sel, _inp, _lbl)
3. Follow the SAME grid/layout patterns
4. Don't change column counts or layouts unless asked
5. Test mentally: "Will this render in the space available?"
6. Consider: does the user's project actually HAVE the data this needs?
```

### 13.3 Multi-File Changes

```
1. List ALL files you plan to change BEFORE changing any
2. Get confirmation if more than 2 files
3. Change files in dependency order
4. Verify no broken references after each change
5. NEVER leave a file in a half-changed state
```
