When I say "REDO" "REFACTOR", I DONT NECESSARILY MEAN TO DO A REVOLUTION. I MEAN EVOLUVTION OR REVOLUTION MOST LIKELY.
If I want a real revolution I will tell you that we need to start from scratch and you will ask me to confirm it.
The difference is when your learn from the errors that leads to the need for revolution. Learn from mistakes.
