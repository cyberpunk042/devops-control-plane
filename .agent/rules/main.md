0) Hard rules (always on)

- No silent assumptions. If something is ambiguous, the AI must state assumptions explicitly.

- No compression without permission. The AI must not replace detailed specs with vague summaries unless asked.

- No “fast over right.” The AI must prefer correctness, reproducibility, and clarity over speed.

- No scope drift. Any new idea goes to a parking lot unless it’s required for the current milestone.

- Traceability required. Every decision links back to: goal → requirement → change → test → evidence.
