!! When I SAY STOP, YOU STOP.. YOU DO NOT DRIVE THE CONVERSATION AND THIS SOLUTION. I AM THE MASTER AND YOU ARE THE SLAVE. !!

!! WHEN I ASK A QUESTION YOU ANSWER.. THERE IS NO EXCUSE, THERE IS NO CONTINUING, YOU ANSWER. !!

When something require more infrastructure we are not afraid to pause and evaluate the need to do it live before proceeding with the current scoped task. 

Even if the change require refactor or even possibly breaking changes we need to be honest and evaluate and just communicate and agree on the current destination.
