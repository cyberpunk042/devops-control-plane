# Audit Enrichment Plan

## Problem

Every `record_event()` call currently logs a flat notification:
```
💾 File Saved — docs/ADAPTERS.md saved (6,161 bytes)
```

This is an **activity feed**, not an **audit trail**. A proper audit captures
**what changed** — before vs. after state, diffs, counts, etc.

---

## Principle

Every audit entry should answer:
- **What action?** — created / modified / deleted / renamed / encrypted / etc.
- **What target?** — file path, secret name, env name, container, etc.
- **What was the state before?** — lines, size, hash, existence, value
- **What is the state after?** — lines, size, hash, new value
- **What changed?** — diff stats (lines added/removed), size delta

Not every category needs the same depth. Files need diffs. Docker commands
need stdout. Vault operations need key counts. But every entry must be
**meaningful**, not just "something happened."

---

## Current Inventory: 90+ `record_event()` calls across 15 route files

### Category 1: Content File Operations (highest audit value)
**Files:** `routes_content_manage.py`, `routes_content_files.py`, `routes_content.py`

| Current Label | Action | Before/After Data Needed |
|---|---|---|
| 💾 File Saved | `modified` | Before: line count, size, sha256. After: same. Diff: lines +/- |
| 📁 Folder Created | `created` | After: folder name |
| 🗑️ File/Dir Deleted | `deleted` | Before: size, line count (if file), child count (if dir) |
| 📤 File Uploaded | `created` | After: filename, size, type |
| 📝 File Created (new) | `created` | After: line count, size |
| ✏️ File Renamed | `renamed` | Before: old name. After: new name |
| 📂 File Moved | `moved` | Before: old path. After: new path |
| 🔐 File Encrypted | `encrypted` | Before: size. After: encrypted size |
| 🔓 File Decrypted | `decrypted` | Before: encrypted size. After: decrypted size |

**Implementation for "File Modified" (the user's example):**
```python
# BEFORE the write
old_content = target.read_text(encoding="utf-8") if target.is_file() else ""
old_lines = old_content.count("\n") + (1 if old_content else 0)
old_size = len(old_content.encode("utf-8"))

# ... perform the write ...

# AFTER the write
new_lines = file_content.count("\n") + (1 if file_content else 0)
new_size = len(file_content.encode("utf-8"))

# DIFF
added = removed = 0
for tag, i1, i2, j1, j2 in difflib.SequenceMatcher(
    None, old_content.splitlines(), file_content.splitlines()
).get_opcodes():
    if tag == "insert":
        added += j2 - j1
    elif tag == "delete":
        removed += i2 - i1
    elif tag == "replace":
        removed += i2 - i1
        added += j2 - j1

devops_cache.record_event(
    root,
    label="📝 File Modified",
    summary=f"{rel_path}: +{added} -{removed} lines ({old_size:,} → {new_size:,} bytes)",
    detail={
        "action": "modified",
        "target": rel_path,
        "before": {"lines": old_lines, "size": old_size},
        "after":  {"lines": new_lines, "size": new_size},

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Enrich `record_event()` API ✅ DONE
Added optional structured fields to the existing function without breaking anything:
- `action` (str): the verb
- `target` (str): what was acted on  
- `before_state` (dict|None): state before
- `after_state` (dict|None): state after

### Phase 2: Enrich Content File Operations (Category 1) ✅ DONE
File save now captures line-level diffs (+/- lines), before/after sizes.
File delete captures before-state (size, lines, child count).
All 9 content call sites enriched.

### Phase 3: Enrich Vault/Secrets Operations (Category 2) ✅ DONE
15 vault calls + 7 secrets calls enriched.
Lock/unlock captures before/after locked state.
Key operations capture key names and target env file.

### Phase 4: Enrich remaining categories (3-11) ✅ DONE
- **Backup** (12 calls): archive/restore/import/wipe/encrypt/decrypt/upload/delete
- **Docker** (14 calls): build/up/down/restart/prune/generate/pull/exec/remove
- **Terraform** (7 calls): plan/init/apply/destroy/format/workspace/generate
- **CI** (2 calls): workflow/lint generation
- **Testing** (3 calls): test run/coverage/template
- **DNS** (1 call): record generation
- **DevOps Apply** (7 calls): git/github/docker/k8s/ci/terraform setup + delete
- **DevOps Audit** (2 calls): dismiss/undismiss
- **Config** (1 call): project.yml save

**Total: 80 success-path calls enriched. 12 error-path calls left as-is (by design).**

### Phase 5: Update UI rendering ✅ DONE
The Audit Log UI (`_debugging.html` → `loadDebugAuditScans`) now renders:
- **Action badge**: color-coded uppercase verb (MODIFIED, DELETED, ENCRYPTED, etc.)
- **Target path**: monospace rendering of the affected resource
- **Before → After cards**: side-by-side comparison with red/green tinted backgrounds
- Size values auto-formatted with locale separators + "B" suffix
- Raw JSON detail toggle preserved for power users

## Scope Consideration

This is a significant but **evolutionary** change:
- `record_event()` API is extended, not replaced
- Existing entries still work (no breaking change)
- Each route file is updated independently
- UI rendering is updated once to handle new fields

~90 call sites across 15 files. 80 enriched, 12 error-only events left as-is.

### Phase 6: Consolidate `_audit()` into shared helper ✅ DONE
Created `src/core/services/audit_helpers.py` with:
- `audit_event(card, label, summary, **kwargs)` — direct call
- `make_auditor(card)` — factory that returns a pre-bound `_audit(label, summary, **kwargs)`

Replaced **17 identical** `_audit()` copy-paste functions across:
vault.py, vault_io.py, vault_env_ops.py, backup_archive.py, backup_extras.py,
backup_restore.py, content_file_ops.py, content_crypto.py, testing_ops.py,
terraform_ops.py, docker_containers.py, docker_generate.py, secrets_ops.py,
ci_ops.py, dns_cdn_ops.py, config_ops.py, tool_install.py

Each now uses: `from src.core.services.audit_helpers import make_auditor; _audit = make_auditor("card_name")`

### Phase 7: Add audit + logger to unaudited services ✅ DONE
Added `make_auditor` + `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` to **12 services** that perform
user-facing write operations but lacked audit instrumentation:
content_release.py, content_optimize.py, content_optimize_video.py, git_ops.py,
env_ops.py, k8s_wizard.py, k8s_generate.py, k8s_cluster.py, k8s_helm.py,
wizard_ops.py, security_scan.py, pages_engine.py

Also added standalone `logger` to 3 services that were missing it:
docker_common.py, k8s_validate.py, md_transforms.py

Skipped (read-only / pure utility / re-export hubs):
backup_ops.py, docker_ops.py, k8s_ops.py, security_ops.py, detection.py,
docker_detect.py, k8s_common.py, k8s_detect.py, metrics_ops.py,
project_probes.py, quality_ops.py, staleness_watcher.py, event_bus.py, etc.

### Phase 8: Audit Log UI — pagination, filtering, search ✅ DONE
Enhanced the Debugging → Audit Log panel:

**Server-side** (`routes_api.py` `/audit/activity`):
- `offset`/`limit` pagination (default: 50 entries per page)
- `card` filter (exact match on card type)
- `q` text search (case-insensitive, searches label/summary/target/card)
- Returns `total_all`, `total_filtered`, `has_more`, `cards[]` for UI

**Client-side** (`_debugging.html` + `_tab_debugging.html`):
- Search input with 🔍 icon and 300ms debounce
- Card-type dropdown filter (auto-populated from server)
- "X of Y entries" filtered count label
- Total entry count badge next to "Audit Log" title
- "⬇ Load more" button for lazy-loading next page
- Entry list capped at 600px with scroll
- Entries now sorted newest-first by server (no client-side reversal)
- Card badge now shows actual card name instead of generic "DevOps"
- Rendering logic extracted to `_renderAuditEntry()` function for reuse
